# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithm implementations, completed as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The projects were developed collaboratively by Lucas Niel and Anzo Hitte.

## Description

This repository includes implementations of various sorting algorithms in C, along with corresponding helper functions and test files. The project aims to deepen understanding of sorting techniques, their complexities, and their applications.

## Project Structure

- `sort.h`: Header file containing all the function prototypes and struct definitions.
- `print_array.c`: Helper function to print arrays.
- `print_list.c`: Helper function to print linked lists.

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - `0-bubble_sort.c`: Function that implements the bubble sort algorithm.

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - `1-insertion_sort_list.c`: Function that implements the insertion sort algorithm for doubly linked lists.

3. **Selection Sort**
   - `2-selection_sort.c`: Function that implements the selection sort algorithm.

4. **Quick Sort**
   - `3-quick_sort.c`: Function that implements the quick sort algorithm.

## How to Use

Each C file in this repository contains a specific sorting algorithm. To use these functions, include the `sort.h` header file in your project and compile the C files with your code.

## Compilation
To compile the code, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <source_files> -o <output_file>
```
